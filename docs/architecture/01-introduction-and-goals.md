# Introduction and goals

## High-level requirements

- Allow comparing two files to review what changed.
- Allow copying/exporting patches to share with others.
- Allow export of selections to share with others.

## Quality goals

- The application must be fast, we don't want to wait for the app to start.
- The application must be terminal-based to allow to run across SSH sessions.
- The use of the application must be ergonomic. We should allow users to select
  files or specify them in the command-line of the application. The application
  should be self-explanatory.
